            <h4>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>

            <p>Generally, some of the Services require us to know who you are so that we can best meet
            your needs. When you access the Services, or through any interaction with us via emails,
            telephone calls or other correspondence, we may ask you to voluntarily provide us with
            certain information that personally identifies you or could be used to personally identify you.

            <p>Docfliq will be free to use, collect and disclose information that is freely available in the
            public domain without your consent.</p>

            <h4>PRIVACY STATEMENTS</h4>
            <p>Accordingly, a condition of each User’s use of and access to the Services is their
                acceptance of the Terms and Conditions, which also involves acceptance of the terms of this
                Privacy Policy. Any User that does not agree with any provisions of the same has the option
                to discontinue the Services provided by Docfliq immediately.
            </p>
            <p>    All the information provided to Docfliq by a User is voluntary. You understand that Docfliq
                may use certain information of yours (a) for the purpose of providing you the Services, (b) for
                commercial purposes and in an aggregated or non-personally identifiable form for research,
                statistical analysis and business intelligence purposes, (c) for sale or transfer of such
                research, statistical or intelligence data in an aggregated or non-personally identifiable form to third parties and affiliates (d) for communication purpose so as to provide You a better
                way of booking appointments and for obtaining feedback, (e) debugging customer support
                related issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                Docfliq also reserves the right to use information provided by or about the User for the
                following purposes:
            </p>
            <ul>1. Contacting Users for offering new products or services.</ul>
            <ul>2. Contacting Users for taking product and Service feedback.</ul>
            <ul>3. Analysing software usage patterns for improving product design and utility.</ul>
            <ul>4. Analysing anonymized practice information for commercial use.</ul>

            <p>By affirming your assent to this Privacy Policy, you provide your consent to such use,
                collection and disclosure as required under applicable law.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such
                as your contact information provided as part of account registration. If your personal
                information changes, you may correct, delete inaccuracies, or amend information by making
                the change on our member information page or by contacting us. We will make good faith
                efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably
                practicable. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, out of date or
                incomplete (or becomes untrue, inaccurate, out of date or incomplete), or Docfliq has
                reasonable grounds to suspect that the information provided by you is untrue, inaccurate,
                out of date or incomplete, Docfliq may, at its sole discretion, discontinue the provision of the
                Services to you. There may be circumstances where Docfliq will not correct, delete or update
                your personal data, including (a) where the personal data is opinion data that is kept solely
                for evaluative purpose; and (b) the personal data is in documents related to a prosecution if
                all proceedings relating to the prosecution have not been completed.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to
                provide you Services, contact us. We will retain your information for as long as your account
                with the Services is active and as needed to provide you the Services. We shall not retain
                such information for longer than is required for the purposes for which the information may
                lawfully be used or is otherwise required under any other law for the time being in force.
                After a period of time, your data may be anonymized and aggregated, and then may be held
                by us as long as necessary for us to provide our Services effectively, but our use of the
                anonymized data will be solely for analytic purposes. Please note that your withdrawal of
                consent, or cancellation of account may result in Docfliq being unable to provide you with its
                Services or to terminate any existing relationship Docfliq may have with you.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish to opt-out of receiving non-essential communications such as promotional and
                marketing-related information regarding the Services, please send us an email.
            </p>
            <p>
                Docfliq may require the User to pay with a credit card, wire transfer, debit card or cheque for
                Services for which amount(s) is/are payable. Docfliq will collect such User’s credit card
                number and/or other financial institution information such as bank account numbers and will
                use that information for the billing and payment processes, including but not limited to the
                use and disclosure of such credit card number and information to third parties as necessary
                to complete such billing operation. Verification of credit information, however, is
                accomplished solely by the User through the authentication process. User’s credit-card/debit
                card details are transacted upon secure sites of approved payment gateways which are
                digitally under encryption, thereby providing the highest possible degree of care as per
                current technology. However, Docfliq provides you an option not to save your payment
                details. User is advised, however, that internet technology is not full proof safe and User
                should exercise discretion on using the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when a User or the End-User or
                anyone who visits the Website, Docfliq automatically receives the URL of the site from which
                anyone visits. Docfliq also receives the Internet Protocol (IP) address of each User’s
                computer (or the proxy server a User used to access the World Wide Web), User’s computer
                operating system and type of web browser the User is using, email patterns, as well as the
                name of User’s ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help Docfliq
                improve its Service. The linkage between User’s IP address and User’s personally
                identifiable information is not shared with or disclosed to third parties. Notwithstanding the
                above, Docfliq may share and/or disclose some of the aggregate findings (not the specific
                data) in anonymized form (i.e., non-personally identifiable) with advertisers, sponsors,
                investors, strategic partners, and others in order to help grow its business.

                The Website uses temporary cookies to store certain information that is used by Docfliq and
                its service providers for the technical administration of the Website, research and
                development, and for User administration. In the course of serving advertisements or
                optimizing services to its Users, Docfliq may allow authorized third parties to place or
                recognize a unique cookie on the User’s browser. The cookies however, do not store any
                personal information of the User. You may adjust your internet browser to disable cookies. If cookies are disabled you may still use the Website, but the Website may be limited in the
                use of some of the features.
            </p>
            <p>
                A User may have limited access to the Website without creating an account on the Website.
                In order to have access to all the features and benefits on our Website, a User must first
                create an account on our Website. To create an account, a User is required to provide the
                following information, which such User recognizes and expressly acknowledges is personal
                information allowing others, including Docfliq, to identify the User: name, User ID, email
                address, state, ZIP/postal code, age, phone number, password chosen by the User and valid
                financial account information. Other information requested on the registration page, including
                the ability to receive promotional offers from Docfliq, is optional. Docfliq may, in future,
                include other optional requests for information from the User to help Docfliq to customize the
                Website to deliver personalized information to the User.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy applies to any and all Services that are owned and operated by Docfliq.
                Docfliq does not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results or links from
                within its Services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on the Users’
                computer, collect data or solicit personal information from the Users, for which Docfliq is not
                responsible or liable. Accordingly, Docfliq does not make any representations concerning the
                privacy practices or policies of such third parties or Terms and Conditions of such websites,
                nor does Docfliq guarantee the accuracy, integrity, or quality of the information, data, text,
                software, sound, photographs, graphics, videos, messages or other materials available on
                such websites. The inclusion or exclusion does not imply any endorsement by Docfliq of the
                website, the website&#39;s provider, or the information on the website. If you decide to visit a
                third-party website linked to the Website, you do this entirely at your own risk. Docfliq
                encourages the User to read the privacy policies of that website.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Website may enable User to communicate with other Users or to post information to be
                accessed by others, whereupon other Users may collect such data. Such Users, including
                any moderators or administrators, are not authorized Docfliq representatives or agents, and
                their opinions or statements do not necessarily reflect those of Docfliq, and they are not
                authorized to bind Docfliq to any contract. Docfliq hereby expressly disclaims any liability for
                any reliance or misuse of such information that is made available by Users or visitors in such
                a manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                Docfliq has implemented best international market practices and security policies, rules and
                technical measures to protect the personal data that it has under its control from
                unauthorised access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorised modification and unlawful destruction or accidental loss. However, for any data loss or theft due to unauthorized
                access to the User’s electronic devices through which the User avails the Services, Docfliq
                shall not be held liable for any loss whatsoever incurred by the User.
            </p>
            <p>
                Docfliq implements reasonable security practices and procedures and has a comprehensive
                documented information security programme and information security policies that contain
                managerial, technical, operational and physical security control measures that are
                commensurate with respect to the information being collected and the nature of Docfliq’s
                business.
            </p>
            <p>
                Docfliq takes your right to privacy very seriously and other than as specifically stated in this
                Privacy Policy, will only disclose your personal information in the event it is required to do so
                by law, rule, regulation, law enforcement agency, governmental official, legal authority or
                similar requirements or when Docfliq, in its sole discretion, deems it necessary in order to
                protect its rights or the rights of others, to prevent harm to persons or property, to fight fraud
                and credit risk, or to enforce or apply the Terms and Conditions.</p>

            <h4>CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY</h4>
            <p>
                Your personal information is maintained by Docfliq in electronic form on its equipment, and
                on the equipment of its employees. Such information may also be converted to physical form
                from time to time. Docfliq takes all necessary precautions to protect your personal
                information both online and off-line, and implements reasonable security practices and
                measures including certain managerial, technical, operational and physical security control
                measures that are commensurate with respect to the information being collected and the
                nature of Docfliq’s business.
            </p>
            <p>
                No administrator at Docfliq will have knowledge of your password. It is important for you to
                protect against unauthorized access to your password, your computer and your mobile
                phone. Be sure to log off from the Website when finished. Docfliq does not undertake any
                liability for any unauthorised use of your account and password. If you suspect any
                unauthorized use of your account, you must immediately notify Docfliq by sending an email.
                You shall be liable to indemnify Docfliq due to any loss suffered by it due to such
                unauthorized use of your account and password.
                Docfliq makes all User information accessible to its employees, agents or partners and third
                parties only on a need-to-know basis, and binds only its employees to strict confidentiality
                obligations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Docfliq is not responsible for the confidentiality, security or distribution of your personal
                information by our partners and third parties outside the scope of our agreement with such
                partners and third parties. Further, Docfliq shall not be responsible for any breach of security
                or for any actions of any third parties or events that are beyond the reasonable control of
                Docfliq including but not limited to, acts of government, computer hacking, unauthorised
                access to computer data and storage device, computer crashes, breach of security and
                encryption, poor quality of Internet service or telephone service of the User etc.
            </p>

            <h4>CHANGE TO PRIVACY POLICY</h4>

            <p>
                Docfliq may update this Privacy Policy at any time, with or without advance notice. In the
                event there are significant changes in the way Docfliq treats User’s personally identifiable
                information, or in the Privacy Policy itself, Docfliq will display a notice on the Website or send
                Users an email, as provided for above, so that you may review the changed terms prior to
                continuing to use the Services. As always, if you object to any of the changes to our terms,
                and you no longer wish to use the Services, you may contact us to deactivate your account.
                Unless stated otherwise, Docfliq’s current Privacy Policy applies to all information that
                Docfliq has about you and your account.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a User uses the Services or accesses the Website after a notice of changes has been sent
                to such User or published on the Website, such User hereby provides his/her/its consent to
                the changed terms.
            </p>

            <h4>CHILDREN&#39;S AND MINOR&#39;S PRIVACY</h4>

            <p>Docfliq strongly encourages parents and guardians to supervise the online activities of their
                minor children and consider using parental control tools available from online services and
                software manufacturers to help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools also
                can prevent minors from disclosing their name, address, and other personally identifiable
                information online without parental permission. Although the Docfliq Website and Services
                are not intended for use by minors, Docfliq respects the privacy of minors who may
                inadvertently use the internet or the mobile application.</p>
